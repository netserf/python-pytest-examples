# python_unittest_examples v.0.1.0

## What?
A project for collecting various python unit testing tips and tricks.

The first module will be based on notes compiled from Python Testing with pytest
written by Brian Okken. Depending on how this goes there may be more modules to
come.

## Why?
I need more practice with unit testing. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

### Usage
1. Simple passing test
`$ pytest -v python_unittest_examples/ch1/test_one.py`

2. Simple failing test
`$ pytest -v python_unittest_examples/ch1/test_two.py`

### Installation
A python interpreter is required with pip and pytest installed.

### Testing
```
$ python setup.py test
```

## Requirements
- pytest

## Future Improvements
- TBD
